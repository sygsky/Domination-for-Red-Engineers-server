    Attention: First time you appear inside mission airborne near Antigua island (map N-E).<br>
    <p align="center"><a href="#INTR_ANTIGUA"><font size="2">More about Antigua.</font></a></p><br>
    Chicken-ass smugglers was too afraid flying by warzone, so they decided to get rid of you here, blessing you with a kick.<br>
    Use caution when landing - horizontal velocity should not exceed 6 clicks per hour and try to avoid slopes.<br>
    Start looking for a locals. You'll recognise one as soon as you hear them.<br>
    Locals can provide you with pieces of valuable info, like: how to get to the base, is there anybody on Antigua besides you, weapons cache location, etc.<br>
    It's up to you to choose the way to the base: by car, boat, chopper from base (you have to ask other players to help you with that), biplane or simply hiking.<br>
    Try to avoid encounters with enemy on your way to the base.<br>
    Remember - for now you just need to register at the base by crossing its boundaries!<br>
    You can deal with enemy later! On the other side - if you feel lucky or confident enough,<br>
    you still can engage enemy, but if failed you will have to start from Antigua again. (Translated by Snooper)<br><br>

    The main task of our mission is to prevent the destruction of the USSR into separate quasi-states under the control
    of the Federal Reserve System, which will lead to incalculable casualties among the population of the USSR,
    the decay of the economy tenfold, the transformation of culture into a
    means of degradation, zombification of the entire population, numerous conflicts on ethnic grounds, impossible under the USSR.

    The enemy are the US troops.<br>
    You have to free the island from all enemy forces.<br>
    To clear a target kill almost all enemies, destroy the radio tower at the main target and solve the main target
    sidemission.<br>
    <br><br>There are many (more 50) several side missions available that will get you some extra very good land
    vehicles if you solve them.
    <br><br>
    Once a main target is clear, a flag is created in a random place from where you can jump with the HALO parajump
    script.
    <br><br>
    You can transport many vehicles with your Mi17 choppers, except heavy vehicles like M1, T72, Shilka, BMP (MHQ BMP is
    allowed to fly) etc.<br><br>
    The MHQ BMPs are your mobile respawn points.<br>
    You can drop an ammo crate if you are the driver of a MHQ BMP or the pilot of a helicopter (but you have to load a
    crate at base)!<br>
    The maximum number of ammo crates simultaneously is 6. An ammo crate gets only deleted if the crate was
    destroyed.<br>
    Reload a crate into chopper 1,2,3 or W or in one of the MHQs, otherwise you will end up at the next target without
    any crate.
    <br><br>
    The engineers can repair and refuel all vehicles and aircraft. <br>
    That only works once if no salvage truck or repair truck is near an engineer (reload and refuel capability can get
    restored at base).
    Engineers can also load static weapons like D30, DSHKM, etc, in Ural salvage trucks, and unload them wherever they
    want.
    Engineers are also able to flip tanks that are lying upside down when they have ANY repair truck near them.
    <br><br>
    The flag at your base can be used as a teleporter to your mobile respawns or you can choose parajump there (if
    enabled by admin).
    <BR><BR>
    If a vehicle that you've won for solving a sidemission or clearing a main target gets destroyed you can transport
    the wreck with chopper 4 (W) to the wreck repair point at your base and you'll get a new one. But only man with some
    rank can do this!<br>
    Chopper 4 (W) can only transport wrecks, nothing else. Height for wreck pick-up is >= 2.5 meters.
    <BR><BR>
    The artillery operators can fire artillery strikes about every six minutes. They are also able to rescue hostages.
    You have to bring the hostages to the <a href="marker:teleporter">flag</a> at your base.
    <BR><BR>
    The leaders of team Alpha or team Charlie (alpha_1 and charlie_1) can call in air drop. A chopper will bring an
    artillery cannon or a vehicle or a ammobox.
    <BR><BR>
    MG Gunners can place MG nests, medics can place mashs.
    <BR><BR>
    If you have the freelook bug/headbug press the "Fix Headbug" button in the status dialog (available at mobile
    respawn) to fix this annoying bug.
    <br>
    You can also change the viewdistance and other settings in the STATUS dialog, just press one of the buttons.
    <br><br>
    It is also possible to put the primary weapon in your backpack. You are then able to take another primary weapon and
    switch between the weapon in the backpack and the currently selected weapon.
    <br>The night on the Sahrni is rather short, and night is skipped from 21:00 to 03:00!<br><br>
    Additional information.<br>
    The conditions of the liberation of the city, captured by the enemy for the first time: in a square having a side of
    350 meters in the city centre should be no more than 5 enemy soldiers, no tanks and not more than one car<br>
    The conditions for the exemption of any occupied city: needs to stay alive and in good condition enemy soldiers and
    armored vehicles to the total number of not more than 5. The distance doesn't matter.<br><br>
    Mandatory rules of this server:<br>
    a) one of the MHQ (Rep. of) should always stay on the base,<br>
    b) Always give back transport Mi-17 with numbers 1 and 2 on the base after use,<br>
    b) don't use this server as a training camp! You and we all be satisfied with it!<br><br>

<h6><h1 align="center"><a name="INTR"></a><u>Introduction to the topic</u><br>
    01 August 1985, 8 a.m.</h1><br>
    A dark menace looms to the peace and prosperity people of the planet. Moneybags of US, driven by thirst of the world
    domination, developed an occupation plan of little independent island Sahrani. Using their agent codenamed "Lawyer"
    - high ranked member of Soviet Union Communist Party Central Commitee, they planning to avoid involvement of Soviet
    Army in this conflict. Both those facts didn't escape of russian intellingence agent vigilant eye.<br>

    Information consealment for the Sahrani invasion is supposed to be conducted by means of mass media (newspapers,
    magazines, radio, television, internet). Main bulk of information will be spreaded by "The Wall Street Journal",
    "Daily Telegraph" and "Playboy" magazine. Russian spy report also contains blueprints of some device codenamed
    "Brain switcher". Accordingly to technical department stuff opinion this device is kind of high-power emitter of
    unknown type radiation. It also has fastenings widely used for mounting on urban telecommunication towers.<br>

    Immediatelly this information was sent to agent supervisor. Considering high probability of having traitors among
    higher stuff and in order to exclude probability of red tape by high ranking officers it was decided to try to
    destroy FRS-CIA plans by own means.<br>

    By secret meeting of mankind-minded intelligence officers it was decided to counteract to evil plans of the enemies
    of mankind and peace. This only could be carried out with help of international volunteers, ready to sacrifice
    yourself to the humanity future cause.<br>

    So, you have been informed by your friends about marvelous hunting and fishing taken place on tropical island in
    the Atlantic, and that's why you have left your military service to enjoy this opportunity.Scratching your ass after
    heavy parachute landing and listening to brief lecture, given to you by scary man in military outfit you soon
    realise, that ticket back could be earned only by arranging meeting between unfriendly US army fellows and their
    creator.<br>

    Government of Sahrani operating in underground cooperates with us, despite nobody seen them or their people.<br>
    (Here follows untranslatable piece of russian poetry.)<br>

    Us free willingly arrived to this island by call of heart or by mind effort will decide the future of the peace on
    Earth!<br>

    P.S. While being at island You will be carrying chevron with kinda "whothehellknowswhatthatmeans" sign, possibly
    related to some kind of military group. Being captured you should spit to enemy face while smiling mocking smile. Do
    not ask me why!(I don't know it either...)<br>

<h6><h1 align="center"><a name="INTR_ANTIGUA"></a><u>"Arriving in Antigua"</u><br>
    August 01, 1985, 8 am.</h1><br>
    Why are you in Antigua:<br>
    to arrive at the island, our curator at the GRU chartered a DC-3 smugglers plane to deliver personnel to the base.
    But the smugglers, having learned the rumors about the work of the air defense of our enemy, dropped you not over the base, but over the remote island of Antigua, in the very northeast of the archipelago.
    Fortunately, in the southwestern mountainous part of the island lives an aboriginal whom we trust. Your first task is to locate the native and find out from him how to get to the base.<br>
    Aborigine will be able to answer all the necessary questions: <br><br>

    1. What is his name. Be polite and give your name in response.<br>
    2. Where to find the boat. If there is a boat on the island, he will indicate its location. And, most likely, put it on the map!<br>
    As a last resort, try using the boats on the blue marker placed in the southwest of the islet, near the southern end of the sandy airstrip.
    By boat, you can get to the nearby coast, where you can try to find a car or a motorcycle (see question #3), or ... get to the coast near the base, from where you can climb the slope to it. Purple flares are observed over the territory of the base, fired for your orientation. Check-in takes place automatically upon arrival.<br>
    3. In what place of the nearest coast can there be cars. There are 9 cars on the coast. The native will mark one of them on the map.
    You can use any car you find, not just the one marked on the map.<br>
    4. Where is the plane. What kind of plane is this? And this is a museum copy of the World War I biplane, Camel Sopwich.
    In connection with the outbreak of hostilities, it was removed from the storerooms and put into action. This is all the islanders' aircraft available in Antigua. You should look for aircraft only after asking the native about the plane. Otherwise, the plane may not be in place.
    If the plane is busy, in the air or on the ground with the pilot inside, the native will report accurately on his condition.
    In the absence of an aircraft, either wait or use the route by motorboat (boat) or car (points No. 2 and No. 3).<br>
    5. Weapons - the aborigine will report about the weapons closest to him. It could be a crate inside a tent or a weapon thrown on the ground.<br>
    6. People. The native will report the exact number of people in the area of the island. And tell you which side they're on.<br>
    7. Rumors. The aborigine has heard our rumors and is using them in his response.<br>
    8. Invite a native to come with you. It's better not to. Because everyone needs an aborigine and it is better not to try to lure him to another place.<br>
